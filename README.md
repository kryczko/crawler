# IBM Developer Works Crawler

This repository tracks every forum posted on IBM's developer works webpage regarding DB2, and performs a sentiment analysis and text extraction to summarize and/or find relations between the pages.

There are two executible python files:
run:
    $ ./ibm_dw_crawler.py --help 

This will tell you the syntax about command line arguments.
